# QuantumSimulator

This package contains tools for running a finite-difference method simulation of the Schr√∂dinger equation.  Written for Advanced Quantum Mechanics in Spring 2023.

# Example Simulations

Examples for using the simulator can be found in the `Examples` folder.  Included are:
* 1D harmonic oscillator (eigenstate)
* 1D harmonic oscillator (superposition)
* 1D infinite potential well
* 2D infinite potential well
* 2D "approximate" point charge
* 2D "approximate" double slit

These example simulations include a window for viewing their evolution.  For instance, here are the results from the 2D potential well simulation:
